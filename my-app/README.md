# Login Decentralization

## Overview: 
    This project is about how we can decentralize an user account when he/she login to web page.
## Details: 
* First we have a matrix about decentralization like this: 

    | Role | Member | / | /manager | /manager/add-member | /manager/delete-member | /information| /information/view-notification  | /information/add-notification | /products | /products/view-products | products/add-new|
    |-----------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
    | admin | a-1 | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
    |  | a-2 | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
    | user | u-1 | X |||| X | X || X | X | X |
    || u-2 | X |||| X | X || X | X | X |
    || u-3 | X |||| X | X || X | X | X |
    | guest | g-1 | X ||||||| X | X ||
    || g-2 | X ||||||| X | X ||
* About the matrix above: 
    * The first column is a list of all role can access the web.
    * The second column is a list of all member's ids. 
    * Each cells on first row from the third cell is a page's path, each path represents for a page.
    * "X" is mark that a user can access to a path name, empty cells are not.
    * If you login by "admin", you can access all paths.
    * As a member with an id and a role which is not "admin", you can access to all pages thats are mark "X", if not you will be redirected to "/403" is forbidden page (changing URL to access to protected pages is denied).

## What's used to decentralize? 
* Decentralization is executed after navigation bar is rendered.
* Navigation bar's data is a tree data. 
* Class NavBar in **NavBar.tsx** has private attribute is path. "path" is used to store paths which are taken from tree data while rendering NavBar using recursion. These are valid paths that a user can access to a page.
* When we change page by changing URL's path name or click on the navigation bar's cells, we'll have a path name, it can be call by
```js
this.props.location.pathname
```
* After rendering, `componentDidMount` is called, it will check that the current path name is valid or not, if not we will be redirect to "/403". 
```js
componentDidMount() {
    if (!this.path.includes(this.props.location.pathname))
        this.props.history.push("/403")
    }
```
